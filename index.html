          If you do a lot of retouching, you notice that you spend a lot of time switching tools, changing tool size, zoom level etc. Of course, you know the shortcuts and you use a keyboard to do this. You also use a graphic tablet, which in most cases means your keyboard must be moved away from its usual place.
          If like me, you are left-handed, you feel the pain even more when you need to activate certain shortcuts. Wouldn't it be nice to have a very small keyboard to be placed beside your graphic tablet and which allows activating the most useful shortcuts at the press of a single button?

          This is the question I asked myself, and decided that yes, as a photographer I would love to have such a thing. I then remembered, that photography is my hobby but I am first and foremost a software and hardware developer. So Palitra is born. The aim of Palitra was to create a tool that gets the job done
          in the easiest way. It is not fancy, but it really speeds up retouching. I know I cannot work without it anymore. It also will not break your bank, I am using simple and widely available components and aim to make it affordable for any photographer, from the amateur to the pro. The final price will be in
          the $20 to $30 range, depending on the final production costs.

            <span>This is the Palitra hardware. Well, at least its PCB. I have already working prototypes of this device and am now designing an enclosure to make it a robust and nice product. Palitra has 9 buttons in a 3x3 configuration. These buttons are configurable with a shortcut each. To allow for more shortcuts,
Palitra also has 4 buttons (each with a LED indicator) at the top, allowing selecting a logical page. This means the device can have 36 shortcuts configured at the same time, 9 per each page. Palitra is powered by USB and is recognized by the system as a keyboard, so there is no driver to install. Your
favourite retouching software does not need any plug-in or modification to work with Palitra, since again it is just a keyboard from the point of view of the system it is attached to.

              In the future a battery powered, Bluetooth version of Palitra will be created too.

      <p class="app__palitra-keyboard-text">Palitra comes with a configuration application which allows to personalize all shortcuts on the device, as well as display the current ones. The software is quite minimalistic at the moment but very easy to use. During the funding campaign development will proceed to add more features. Top priority is the
        ability to create, import, export and share profiles, so that you can change all shortcuts of your Palitra at the same time by simply choosing the profile for the application you want to work in. The application will also be used to load eventual firmware upgrades to the device.</p>
